BioBig = BIG DATA computing for Ruby.

BioBig is an initiative to a create high performance libraries for
big data computing in biology - initially for the Ruby language.

The Ruby version of BioBig uses BioRuby when sensible, but provides
an interface with a different design. Also it uses BioLib functions
for increased performance and reduced memory use.
