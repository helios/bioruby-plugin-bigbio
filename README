BioBig = BIG DATA computing (for Ruby)

BioBig is an initiative to a create high performance libraries for big data
computing in biology - initially for the Ruby language. 

The Ruby version of BioBig uses BioRuby, when sensible, but provides an
interface with a different design. Also, unlike BioRuby which aims to be pure
Ruby, it uses BioLib C/C++ functions for increased performance and reduced
memory consumption.

Note: this software is in its early stages.
